 <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>  Sorted great circle distances to nearby points on the earth.
 
    Computing great circle distances on the earth between two sets of
    points --- data points and a fixed grid, say --- is computationally 
    expensize.  <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> speeds this up substantially. 
 
    [DS,XS,YS]=<a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF) returns the great
    circle distances DS between data points at locations LAT, LON and 
    nearby grid points located at LATO, LONO, sorting in order of distance. 
 
    XS and YS are the corresponding coordinates of the sorted data points 
    in a local tangent plane about each grid point. 
  
    LAT and LON are arrays of the same size into data point locations.
    Any NaN values in LAT/LON are ignored.  
 
    LATO and LONO are arrays of length M and N, say, specifying the
    latitudes and longitudes of an M x N matrix of grid points, i.e.
 
        LATO =  [LATO_1;    LONO= [LONO_1 LONO_2 ... LONO_N]. 
                 LATO_2; 
                   ...
                 LATO_M]
 
    <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> only computes distances for nearby points, up to a distance 
    of CUTOFF, which is given in kilometers.  CUTOFF should be less than 
    1/4 of the circumference of the earth, <a href="radearth.html">RADEARTH</a> * PI/2, so that sorted
    (LAT,LON) points will lie in the same hemisphere as the grid points.
 
    The output arrays are then all M x N x J arrays where J is the maximum
    number of points in the CUTOFF neighborhood at any grid point.  Entries 
    in the ouput corresponding to farther distances are filled with NaNs.
 
    DS gives the distances of data points less than CUTOFF kilometers 
    from the (m,n)th grid point, sorted in order of increasing distance.  
 
    XS and YS give the coordinates, in kilometers, of the corresponding 
    data points in a plane tangent to the (m,n)th grid point.  See 
    <a href="latlon2xy.html">LATLON2XY</a> and Lilly and Lagerloef (2018) for details.

    Limiting output dimension
 
    <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,LATO,LONO,[CUTOFF JMAX]), where the fifth input 
    argument is a 2-vector, additionally specifies that the third dimension
    of the output arrays will be no more than JMAX. 
 
    This option is useful for the 'fixed population' algorithm in
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>, as it ensures the output fields will be no larger than is
    necessary.  It can also be used simply to limit the output size. 
    _________________________________________________________________
  
    Additional input parameters
 
    Let's say some additional variables Z1, Z2,...,ZK are given at
    the data locations LAT, LON.  Then 
    
        [DS,XS,YS,Z1S,Z2S,...,ZKS]=
            <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(LAT,LON,Z1,Z2,...,ZK,LATO,LONO,CUTOFF);
 
    also returns the sorted values of these variables.
 
    Z1D, Z2D,...,ZKD are the same size as the other output arguments, and 
    give the values of Z1, Z2,...,ZK sorted according to distance.
 
    When there are multiple fields to be mapped, one may instead wish to 
    use the approach described under "One grid, many fields" in <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a>.   
    _________________________________________________________________
   
    Parellel algorithm
 
    <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>(...'parallel') parallelizes the computation using a parfor
    loop implemented over latitudes.  This requires Matlab's Parallel 
    Computing Toolbox to be installed. 
 
    Also, depending on the size of dataset, the parallel algorith may lead
    to memory problems, so it should be used judiciously.  For large
    datasets, try combining an external loop over longitude with the
    parallel algorithm over latitude.
