# Functions
Contains useful functions for MATLAB, Python, R etc. Some of these are written by me, some are written by others for which I take no credit. Use at your own risk.

It may help to include

```Matlab
% add function path
addpath(genpath('path/to/Functions'));
```
at the top of your code or add it to your startup file. This will allow MATLAB to look into the functions folder and any subfolders within it.
